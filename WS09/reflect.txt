*** [Skill learnt] ***

	WORKSHOP 9

	1. Printing sequence
	The write function in workshop 9 contain a boolean for printing purpose.

	It is to check if there is consecutive whitespaces. If yes, boolean will turn to true. If the next one is not as well a whitespaces, we change boolean back to false. The first whitespace will remain the same but the following whitespaces will be changed to "&nbsp". 

	I tried find another way to perform the same, however, the changes happen on the current whitespace but not the following one. I think using boolean is the easiest way to solve this problem.


	MS3
	
	1. src = src.operator bool()
	Almost in every workshop if there is operator bool(), I will call the function by its full name, for example "if(src.operator bool())". In fact, coding it as "if(src)" will perform the same way.
	
	

*** [Difficulties] ***

	MS3
	
	1. char *variable vs char variable[] for local variable
	I was confused when defining the type for local variable in Read function. 
	
	At first I tried to define the local variable temp_title as the same type as the private member m_title which hold dynamic memory. 
	
	Obviously it was wrong. If I define it as char *temp_title, I would still need another static string variable to get size of the string and assign dynamic memories for temp_title. 
	
	2. setting wrong conditions in function Publication::set()
	I want to check if member_id exist before assign it to data member, therefore I have the condition as "if(member_id)". Since memberId can be zero or 5-digit. When the ID is zero, I could not assign it to data member which was totally wrong.
	
	
	MS4
	
	1. write() in Book.cpp
	We are required to print only up to 15 characters for the author name.
	I tried to use for-loop to print the characters one by one, however the spacing was very weird when after I display them with <iomanip> function (i.e. setw, left and setfill). I do not know how to fix it, so I just store them in another variable which takes only upto 15 characters with strncpy.
	
	
	2. Not comfident with the use of get and getline
	When I use getline, only 110 records is printed to the console.
	I noticed that I printed one record and skipped the following one, then I assume something is wrong with my cin.
	
	After I changed it to get, it gets all 220 records correctly.
	
	Getline: discards the newline character and does not include it in the string that it stores.
	Get: newline character is also read by get and included in the character array it stores.
	
	I guess I might have skipped the records because of discarding the newline character with getline. And that might related to another provided function getNextRec() where it has a statement ifstr.ignore(1000, '\n').
